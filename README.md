# Explore Network of Letters 1.0.0

The widget offers a link-triggered frontend-popover to show other letters that
contain to the same network of letters. The data is acquired by accessing
the correspSearch API. The widget shows the result as a plain list, styled after
bootstrap standards.

## File structure

    index.html
contains the HTML code you have to include into your website
to create the link 'Explore Network of Letters', which serves
as the trigger for the widget.

    static/css/app.css
contains the standard Bootstrap style information.

    static/js/app.js
contains the Application code. Do not change anything here.

## Setup the widget

1. Copy `static/css/app.css` into your respective folder for style sheets. If you do not have such a folder, create a "css" folder in your root directory and paste the app.css into that folder.
2. Create a link to that style sheet in the header of your HTML file.
3. Copy `static/js/app.js` into your respective folder for JavaScript files.
   If you do not have such a folder, create a "js" folder in your root
   directory and paste the app.js into that folder.
4. Copy the complete `<div>`-Tag of the widget to the place, where you want
   the link to appear.
5. Copy the `<script>`-Tag and paste it _below_ the `<div>` you pasted in Step 3.
   Change the path according to the location of the JavaScript file,
   you copied in Step 3.
6. Change the values of the data attributes in the widget's `<div>` according
   to your needs.
